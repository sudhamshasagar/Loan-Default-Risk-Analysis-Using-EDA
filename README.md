## Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis-Using-EDA

### Problem Statement
In this case study, we aim to analyze loan applications using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns that influence a customer's likelihood of defaulting on a loan. A consumer finance company, specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers, faces challenges when approving loans for applicants with insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Incorrect decisions during loan approval can lead to financial losses for the company, either by rejecting a creditworthy applicant (resulting in loss of business) or by approving a high-risk applicant who may default (resulting in financial loss).

Our objective is to use EDA to identify key factors that indicate whether a client may face difficulty repaying their loan installments. By understanding the driving variables behind loan default, the company can take informed actions such as denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or offering higher interest rates to risky applicants. This analysis will help minimize the risk of financial loss while ensuring that capable customers are not unjustly rejected.

The dataset provided includes information about loan applications, including whether the loan was approved, cancelled, refused, or unused. By analyzing consumer and loan attributes, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships that can be used for portfolio and risk assessment, aiding the company in making better lending decisions.

### Business Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to identify strong indicators of loan default through EDA, enabling the company to:

Deny loans to high-risk applicants.
Adjust loan amounts or interest rates for risky applicants.
Ensure that customers capable of repaying loans are not rejected.
